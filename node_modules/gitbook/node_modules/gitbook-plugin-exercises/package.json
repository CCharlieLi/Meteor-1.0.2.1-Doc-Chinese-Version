  "readme": "Interactive exercices in a gitbook\n==============\n\nWith this plugin, a book can contain interactive exercises (currently only in Javascript). An exercise is a code challenge provided to the reader, who is given a code editor to write a solution which is checked against the book author's validation code.\n\n\n## How to use it?\n\nYou can use install it via **NPM**:\n\n```\n$ npm install gitbook-plugin-exercies\n```\n\nAnd use it for your book with:\n\n```\n$ gitbook build ./ --plugins=exercises\n```\n\n:warning: Don't forget to add it to your package.json and book.json.\n\n\n## Exercises format\n\nAn exercise is defined by 4 simple parts:\n\n* Exercise **Message**/Goals (in markdown/text)\n* **Initial** code to show to the user, providing a starting point\n* **Solution** code, being a correct solution to the exercise\n* **Validation** code that tests the correctness of the user's input\n\nExercises need to start and finish with a separation bar (```---``` or ```***```). It should contain 3 code elements (**base**, **solution** and **validation**). It can contain a 4th element that provides **context** code (functions, imports of libraries, etc which shouldn't be displayed to the user).\n\n    ---\n\n    Define a variable `x` equal to 10.\n\n    ```js\n    var x =\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    var x = 10;\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    assert(x == 10);\n    ```\n\n    ```js\n    // This is context code available everywhere\n    // The user will be able to call magicFunc in his code\n    function magicFunc() {\n        return 3;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ---\n\n",
